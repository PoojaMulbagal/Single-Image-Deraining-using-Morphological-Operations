# Single-Image-Deraining-using-Morphological-Operations
The primary objective of this report is to introduce and explain a comprehensive image restoration process for rain-damaged images. This process involves several key steps, including image smoothing, raindrop extraction, noise removal, inpainting, and image enhancement techniques.

**Detailed Workflow**
This code implements an image restoration pipeline in MATLAB to address the common issue of rain-induced image degradation. The objective is to enhance and restore images affected by raindrops, black streaks, and noise artifacts, resulting in a visually improved image. The pipeline comprises several key steps, including image smoothing, raindrop extraction, noise removal, inpainting, and enhancement techniques. The process begins with the acquisition of a rain-affected image and involves various image processing operations. These operations include Gaussian filtering for image smoothing, morphological operations for raindrop extraction, median filtering for noise removal, and inpainting to fill black streaks. Further, contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and image sharpening are applied to enhance image details and overall quality. 
The provided MATLAB code offers a comprehensive and practical solution for restoring rain-damaged images, with the flexibility to adjust parameters as needed for specific image restoration tasks.
This pipeline serves as a valuable tool for improving the visual quality of images affected by environmental factors, making it useful for a wide range of applications in digital image processing and computer vision.
